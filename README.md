# SunTimeTrackerWidget aka SunApplication

## Updates 

### Place Picker Removal
As of [specific version or date], the Place Picker functionality has been removed from the application. This change is in line with the updated user experience guidelines and to ensure the application's compliance with the latest service terms.

### Home Widget Implementation
I'm excited to announce that starting from [06/01/2024], I have begun the implementation of a new home widget feature. This widget will allow users to access sunrise and sunset times directly from their home screen, making it more convenient than ever to get this information at a glance.

## Overview
SunApplication is an Android app developed by Roman Tsisyk, designed to provide users with real-time sunrise and sunset information based on their location. This is especially useful for photographers, travelers, or anyone interested in these natural events.

## Features
- **Automatic Location Detection**: Fetch sunrise and sunset times based on the user's current location.
- **Manual Location Selection**: Option for users to manually select a location for obtaining sunrise and sunset times.
- **User-Friendly Design**: An intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface.
